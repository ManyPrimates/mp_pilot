## Structure

Raw data files, as submitted from each lab, are stored in `data/raw_data/`. 

The merged dataset is stored in `data/merged_data`. The code for data pre-processing prior to merging the datasets can be found in `analysis/01_data_processing.Rmd`. In this files, we also insert life expectancy for each species and calculate the normed age per subject. 

The file `analysis/02_visualization.Rmd` contains code for some preliminary visualizations. 

In `analysis/04_inference.Rmd` we are running simple inferential statistics. 

The code for the model we use to analyse the combined data set is in `analysis/05_mixedmodel.Rmd`.
