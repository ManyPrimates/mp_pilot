# Summary

Mixed modeling with all relevant variables predicting accuracy

From the preregistration, the mixed model was specified thusly:

```
correct ~ delay * age + 
          task_experience + cup_distance + board_size + trial +
          (1 + delay + trial | site/subject/block/hiding_location ) + 
          (1 + task_experience + cup_distance + board_size + trial + delay | species)
```

In the dataframe, 
`subject_site = subject`,
and `norm_age` should be used for `age`.

Model as pre-registered has too many random effects

```
Error: number of observations (=6246) < number of random effects (=10608) for term (1 + delay + trial | hiding_location:(block:(subject_site:site))); the random-effects parameters are probably unidentifiable
```

Pruning random effects in the following order (from preregistration): 

> - Remove correlations between random effects
> - Remove random slopes (in the following order)
>     - `species`
>     - `hiding_location`
>     - `block`
>     - `subject`

Model only converges once we take out `hiding_location`. After doing so, the other random effects (correlation, site, species) can be put back in.

The model below converges. Model output is saved in `06_mp_model_v2.rds`

```
correct ~ delay * norm_age + 
          task_experience + cup_distance + board_size + trial + 
          (1 + delay + trial | site/subject_site) + 
          (1 + task_experience + cup_distance + board_size + trial + delay | species)
```

## Reduced model

After pruning random effects with little variability and removing `board_size`, which covaried with `cup_distance`, the reduced model has the following structure. It is saved in `06_mp_3_model3_v2.rds`

```
correct ~ delay * norm_age + 
          task_experience + cup_distance + trial + 
          (1 + delay | site/subject_site) + 
          (1 + delay | species)
```

# Data prep

Data import

```{r loading data}
mp_data <- read.csv("../data/merged_data/01_manyprimates_pilot_merged_data_v2.csv")
```

Prepare code for pre-registered mixed modeling

- center `cup_distance`, `board_size` and `trial`
- filter out spider monkey. Only one data point so far, therefore this is not worth including to explode the number of random effects

```{r}
model.data <- mp_data %>%
  filter(species != "black_faced_spider_monkey") %>%
  mutate_at(vars(cup_distance, board_size, trial), funs(scale(.)[, 1])) %>%
  mutate(hiding_location = factor(hiding_location),
         delay = fct_relevel(delay, "short"))
```

# Model 1

The model takes a while to run. Run next line to load model output from previous run with structure below.

```{r}
# mm.1 <- readRDS("06_mp_model.rds")
mm.1 <- readRDS("06_mp_model_v2.rds")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mm.1 <- glmer(correct ~ delay * norm_age +
               task_experience + cup_distance + board_size + trial +
               (1 + delay + trial | site/subject_site/block) +
               (1 + task_experience + cup_distance + board_size + trial + delay | species)
             , data = model.data
             , family = binomial
             , control = glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa", optCtrl = list(maxfun = 2e5))
             )

saveRDS(mm.1, "06_mp_model_v2.rds")
```

Some diagnostics

- examining Cholesky decomposition

```{r}
theta <- getME(mm.1, "theta")
diag.element <- getME(mm.1, "lower") == 0
any(theta[diag.element] < 1e-5)
```

## Model summary

Confirm model structure

```{r}
# mm.1@call
formula(mm.1)
```

```{r, results="asis"}
glance(mm.1) %>% kable(digits = 2)
```

## Random effects

```{r}
fmt <- function(num, digits) return(round(num, digits))
VarCorr(mm.1) %>% print(formatter = fmt, digits = 3) # comp = c("Variance", "Std.Dev.")
```

## Fixed effects

CIs

```{r}
mm.1.ci <- confint(mm.1, method = "Wald") %>% # bootstrap these later
  as.data.frame %>%
  rownames_to_column %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%
  rename(LL = `2.5 %`, UL = `97.5 %`) %>%
  mutate(OR_LL = exp(LL), OR_UL = exp(UL))
```

```{r, results="asis"}
coef(summary(mm.1)) %>%
  as.data.frame %>%
  rownames_to_column() %>%
  mutate(OR = exp(Estimate)) %>%
  left_join(mm.1.ci, by = "rowname") %>%
  select(rowname, OR, OR_LL, OR_UL, Estimate, LL, UL, everything()) %>%
  kable(digits = 3)
```

<!-- ## Correlation of Fixed Effects -->

```{r, eval=FALSE, results="asis"}
corr <- cov2cor(vcov(mm.1)) %>% as.matrix %>% round(2)
corr[upper.tri(corr, diag = T)] <- ""
colnames(corr) <- 1:10
rownames(corr) <- str_c(1:10, " ", rownames(corr))

corr %>% as.data.frame %>% select(-10) %>% rownames_to_column
```

## Pairwise contrasts for delay

based on estimated marginal means

*Note. This wasn't in the preregistration.*

```{r, message=FALSE}
emmeans(mm.1, pairwise ~ delay, type = "response")$contrasts
```

# Model 1 plots

## Fixed effects

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=2.5, message=FALSE}
plot_model(mm.1, title = "Fixed Effects", order.terms = c(7, 4, 3:1, 9:8, 5, 6),
           width = .3, show.values = T, value.size = 2.5, value.offset = .3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, lty = 2) +
  ylim(0, 3)

# Pruning the model

- remove `trial` random slopes within `species` as the estimates in the previous models were essentially 0

```
correct ~ delay * norm_age + 
          task_experience + cup_distance + board_size + trial +
          (1 + delay + trial | site/subject_site ) +         
          (1 + task_experience + cup_distance + board_size + delay | species)
```

## Check colinearity in the previous model

```{r}
col.mm1 <- glm(correct ~ delay + norm_age +
                 task_experience + cup_distance + board_size + trial
               , data = model.data
               , family = binomial)

vif(col.mm1)
```

No signs of high colinaearity.

## Check levels of random effects

Check how many different levels there are within each random effect

```{r}
source("diagnostic_fcns.r")

overview <- fe.re.tab("correct ~ delay + task_experience + board_size + cup_distance + trial", "species", data = model.data)

overview$summary
```

This suggests that, within species, random slopes for `task_experience` does not make much sense as most species have only 1 level. Same is true for `cup_distance` and `board_size`. Indeed, the model summary and random effects plot for `species` confirm that there is little variability in these estimates (they're close to zero). Therefore they are removed.

```
correct ~ delay * norm_age + 
          task_experience + cup_distance + board_size + trial +
          (1 + delay + trial | site/subject_site ) +         
          (1 + delay | species)
```

# Model 2

The model takes a while to run. Run next line to load model output from previous run with structure below.

```{r}
mm.2 <- readRDS("06_2_mp_model2_v2.rds")
# mm.2.ci <- readRDS("06_2_mp_model2_ci_v2.rds")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mm.2 <- glmer(correct ~ delay * norm_age +
              task_experience + cup_distance + board_size + trial +
              (1 + trial + delay | site/subject_site) +
              (1 + delay | species)
              , data = model.data
              , family = binomial
              , control = glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa", optCtrl = list(maxfun = 2e5))
              )

saveRDS(mm.2, "06_2_mp_model2_v2.rds")
```

# Model 3

Remove `trial` from the random slopes for subject/site as it's near zero both in `mm.1` and even more so in `mm.2`

```{r}
VarCorr(mm.2) %>% print(comp = c("Variance", "Std.Dev."), formatter = fmt, digits = 3)
```

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
plot_model(mm.2, type = "re", sort.est = "(Intercept)")[[1]]
```

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=3}
plot_model(mm.2, type = "re", sort.est = "(Intercept)")[[2]]
```

The model takes a while to run. Run next line to load model output from previous run with structure below.

```{r}
mm.3 <- readRDS("06_3_mp_model3_v2.rds")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mm.3 <- glmer(correct ~ delay * norm_age +
              task_experience + cup_distance + board_size  + trial +
              (1 + delay | site/subject_site) +
              (1 + delay | species)
              , data = model.data
              , family = binomial
              , control = glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa", optCtrl = list(maxfun = 2e5))
              )

saveRDS(mm.3, "06_3_mp_model3_v2.rds")

# Model comparison

We're looking for the lowest AIC(c) as the model with the 'best fit' with a reasonable number of parameters. (Too many are penalized by AIC as one way to address overfitting.)

Indeed, the reduced model seems to do a better job of striking that balance between fitting the data with fewer parameters.
